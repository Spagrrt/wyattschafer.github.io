      <h2>The Assignment</h2>
      <p>Over the course of two weeks, we had to track everything we consumed on <a href="https://www.myfitnesspal.com/">myfitnesspal.com</a> in order to find out what our diet looked like in comparison to a perfect healthy diet. The website tracks all of the nutrients in the foods we consume and displays them in charts, comparing them to the reccomended daily dose to show you what nutrients you are consuming too little or too much of!</p>
      <br>
      <h2>The Tracking</h2>
      <p>Tracking the food with <a href="https://www.myfitnesspal.com/">myfitnesspal.com</a> was very easy to do. The two greatest difficulties I had while while tracking what I ate were:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><p><strong>Tracking Water</strong> was pretty difficult because I never really knew the volume of water the glasses/bottles I used were</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Being Away from Home</strong> was difficult because I wouldn't be able to track my food right away and would sometimes forget what I had eaten, although there is a mobile app for this.</p></li>
      </ol>
      <p>These weren't major challenges to overcome, and food tracking for the most part went smoothly</p>
      <br>
      <h2>The Goals</h2>
      <p>After the first week, we were assigned to set goals based off of our current statistics on what we should work on and improve. The three goals were:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><p><strong>I will increase my water intake by drinking at least the recommended 65 ounces of water every day.</strong> I was unable to meet this goal as I never really found time to refill my water bottle throughout the school day, as my classes are basically on opposite sides of the building as each other and had to rush to each one with no time to stop and refill my water bottle.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>I will increase my potassium intake by eating at least one banana every day.</strong> I was unable to meet this goal as we didn't have any bananas at home</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>I will increase my muscular strength by going to the weight room after school on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays every week.</strong> I wasn't able to meet this goal due to a dentist appointment I had on Wednesday of this week.</p></li>
      </ol>
