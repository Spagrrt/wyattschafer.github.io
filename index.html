      <h2>The Assignment</h2>
      <p>Over the course of two weeks, we had to track everything we consumed on <a href="https://www.myfitnesspal.com/">myfitnesspal.com</a> in order to find out what our diet looked like in comparison to a perfect healthy diet. The website tracks all of the nutrients in the foods we consume and displays them in charts, comparing them to the reccomended daily dose to show you what nutrients you are consuming too little or too much of!</p>
