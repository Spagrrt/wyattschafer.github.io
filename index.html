      <h3>Wyatt Schafer</h3>

      <h2>The Assignment</h2>
      <p>Over the course of two weeks, we had to track everything we consumed on <a href="https://www.myfitnesspal.com/">myfitnesspal.com</a> in order to find out what our diet looked like in comparison to a perfect healthy diet. The website tracks all of the nutrients in the foods we consume and displays them in charts, comparing them to the reccomended daily dose to show you what nutrients you are consuming too little or too much of!</p>
      <br>
      <h2>The Tracking</h2>
      <p>Tracking the food with <a href="https://www.myfitnesspal.com/">myfitnesspal.com</a> was very easy to do. The two greatest difficulties I had while while tracking what I ate were:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><p><strong>Tracking Water</strong> was pretty difficult because I never really knew the volume of water the glasses/bottles I used were</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Being Away from Home</strong> was difficult because I wouldn't be able to track my food right away and would sometimes forget what I had eaten, although there is a mobile app for this.</p></li>
      </ol>
      <p>These weren't major challenges to overcome, and food tracking for the most part went smoothly</p>
